## Overview
The first Frontend mentor challenge I solved. Not perfect because it is not responsive because I am still struglling with CSS but I would get used to it.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

I learnt to align items to the center using `margin: 0 auto`
Also learnt to use the font-size to make a word stay on a straight line or break


### Continued development

I would like to learn responsive designs, come back here and make this project more responsive.
I would take KP's 21 days challenge to build responsive design and make this project even more awesome that it is now..


### Useful resources

- [FONTS](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit) - I used this as my default font

## Acknowledgments

A big thanks to Jonas Schmedtmann whose course on [responsive web design](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/) inspired me to attempt this little project and I am quite sure I would attempt more when done...
